      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>Throughout my high school years, I took a few different programming courses for extracurricular activities. I learned about the basics of the most commonly known programming language, Java, along with the basics of both game and web design. Throughout the course, I was able to familiarize myself with several key parts of each language.</p>

      <h2>Extra Courses</h2>
      <p>After high school, I followed up in my programming using a few different methods. I took an HTML course with Epicodus for ten weeks, where I further practiced and learned about the programming language along with a method called pair programming. Presently, I am working in an online course using Treehouse's Techdegree for HTML</p>
